`users` table: table containing each user's credentials and his/her total work hours

	3 columns: `username` varchar(64), `password` varchar(64), and `labor_balance` int(11)

	`username` column is the PRIMARY KEY and has the attributes NOT NULL and BINARY

	Sample data:
		"Username", "password", 0
		"username", "password", 2

`inputs` table: table containing all work hours submissions
	
	5 columns: `id` int(20), `username` varchar(64), `area_name` varchar(255), `hours` int(11), and `date` date

	`id` column is the PRIMARY KEY and has the attribute AUTO_INCREMENT

	`username` has a FOREIGN KEY constraint that references `users`(`username`)

	`username` has attributes ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE

	`area_name` has a FOREIGN KEY constraint that references `work_areas`(`area_name`)

	`area_name` has attributes ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE

	Sample data:
		1, "username", "Trays", 4, "2020-07-27"

		2, "Username", "Hammocks", 5, "2020-07-28"

		3, "username", "Kettle", 1, "2020-07-29"

CREATE TABLE `inputs`(
    id INT(20) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(64),
    `area_name` VARCHAR(255),
    `hours` int(11),
    `date` DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY(`username`) REFERENCES `users`(`username`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY(`area_name`) REFERENCES work_areas(`area_name`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
